					<p>Poverty has, without a doubt and verifiably been one of the most significant social issues and a monstrous progressing deterrent within the present time. Even in the past, poverty has been a colossal issue in society. It is not only the issue of an individual but also an expanding subject of the nation nowadays. Look at the walkways of the present, have you seen the roaming children selling goods so that their parents would survive another day? Until today, no solutions have yet to unravel the said social issue. But through my impressive and very bizarre solution of constraining one child to each family, I will guarantee you that poverty will be gone in no time. Although the fact that this solution may be as well strict and as well brutal, this is the only way to help diminish poverty.</p>
					
					<p>My proposition for my solution is that each family could only bear one child at a time. On the off chance that a family surpasses the said restrain, the “excess” child would be quieted to death or way better, be butchered, and be sold for treasure. The method is as simple as that. Once a family is found out to be having more than one small kid, that small kid’s life would be vanished into the abyss and never to be seen once more. I know this solution is forceful and bloody, but at least it would be successful in tackling this social issue. And besides, I know other movies more blood-shedding than this proposition. Now, let us talk about why and how my exceptionally awe-inspiring and inventive solution could offer assistance in putting poverty to ruins.</p>
					
					<p>First of all, not only does it offer help to the decline of the social issue of poverty, but it also makes a difference in lessening overpopulation and overproduction inside society. Here, you could see that my solution could solve three problems at once! Lesser reproduction between a lovey-dovey couple means less meek children to bear, which obviously, results in reduced overpopulation. Though they cannot produce youngsters as much as they want, it would be less painful for the mother since she could only bear one child. The results would be mutual for both sides.</p>
					
					<p>Secondly, it as well helps the guardians or the “providers” of the family to spare and save cash as well as to purchase lesser assets or resources since they would only pay attention and prioritize to one single child. Now, in case you are inquiring, “How would the poverty save cash without even earning money in the first place?” I must say, that is a great question. The solution there is to just basically toss them away in landfills or dumpster pits so that they could make sellable and profitable products out of pieces of rubbish. In that way, they could hone or promote recycling as well as their resourcefulness and creativity. And from those recycled items made, they may offer them and gain cash. Having only one child per family would allow them to save money, and sparing currency is helpful in the long run!</p>
					
					<p>My final reason is that the kids of a family can worth more than bars of gold. Similar to “A Modest Proposal” by Jonathan Swift, the “excess” children may be sold or leased as slaves for cash or may also be butchered and be made as nourishment for riches in trade.  In Swift’s proposal, the wives were being treated legitimately and properly by their husbands, and their children were also taken care of a lot. The reason is, the healthier a child is, the more valuable its cost would be. In this way, poverty may as well be effortlessly swiped off the social issues list. It would unquestionably be a win-win situation for them!</p>
					
					<p>I am beyond any doubt that a lot of you are criticizing and addressing me on why can’t I make simpler and less shocking solutions. Solutions like donating to the poor, giving them homes, providing them with resources, or giving them free access to healthcare?  My response here is simple; let us see if you could provide food and other needs to hundreds of thousands of individuals enduring in poverty within the nation. Let us observe if it is conceivable to supply the poor people with their fundamental needs considering that our country is now under tremendous debt. And with the current global widespread we have nowadays, wouldn’t it be extremely unsafe and careless to go outside your home to provide the homeless with some few resources? Unless the government makes a move to reduce poverty, our country’s condition right now will worsen within the future.</p>
					
					<p>As I said prior, I made this proposition because no solution has yet to attain victory in eradicating this social issue. With the 17.7 million poverty-stricken individuals dwelling in our country as of the year 2018, it is no question that poverty is a prevalent issue we have nowadays.  With the lack of resources, immense debts, financial crises, as well as the extensive populace development inside the nation, we would not be able to supply sufficient nourishment for the necessitous individuals for them to survive.  With the current spread of COVID-19 in society, we could do nothing but be chained inside our homes and be helpless. These are the reasons why I made this prodigious proposal. It is not only a solution that helps dissipate overpopulation and a solution that aids the deprived to preserve and acquire cash, but it is a solution that will make strides towards the better state and prosperity of this nation.</p>
