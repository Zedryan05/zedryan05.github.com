						<p class="content">Compass is an instrument used for navigation that shows direction, it points you to your
destination. Just like a compass, this website aims to direct people towards the right path. It
leads people to be more aware about the ongoing social issues in our society. It points the
location to different social issues in society so that we could make it a better place. Finally, it
will navigate you to a destination wherein unity and teamwork among people exists. These
are the aims of this website.</p>

        <p>Hello, I am Zedryan Mikell S. Ancheta from 9 - Pinatubo. I am currently 15 years old. Some of my hobbies include listening to music, playing games, and watching Netflix :))) I sometimes read books if I am interested in the plot of the story. My favorite color is dandelion yellow. Some games I play include Superstar JYP (I really like playing rhythm games) and Among Us. I also really enjoy cooking, mostly breakfast.</p>
					
        <p>I made this website on October 2020 for my Computer Science Project! I entitled my website as COMPASS because a compass is used to guide and lead people onto the right direction. People use a compass to pass through obstacles and to arrive at their destination. Through this website, I wanted to make people aware of the various social issues in the society, like poverty. I want people to realize that if these social problems are resolved, the condition of humankind would soon get better and recover from hardships.</p>

        <p>In page 2, I made a satirical essay about poverty with the title, "Poverty's Riches". This essay was actually my project for English! My motivation here is that since poverty was and is still ongoing, I hope someday that poverty would change and our country's condition would soon improve. With the increasing number of the homeless and poor, I wish that solutions for poverty would be made through writings such as these. I hope it helped people become more wary about our current situations and I also hope that it left an impactful message to the people of today. :D</p>
					
        <p>That's all for now! I hope that my website looks nice and I hope that you will appreciate it!</p>
